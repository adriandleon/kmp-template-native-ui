## Generate a signed Bundle

- Create a new KeyStore with an Alias to sign the App, store the keystore file, keystore password,
  the alias name and the alias password securely.
- In Android Studio create a `release` variant signed bundled: `Build > Generate Signed App Bundled`
- Create a txt file with base64 encoded signing key used to sign your app, running this command in the folder where you have your keystore file:
```shell
base64 -i adrian-keystore -o keystore_base64.txt
```
- Add these as `secrets` in GitHub
    - `ANDROID_KEYSTORE`: Put here the content of `keystore_base64.txt` file
    - `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`: Put here the password for your keystore
    - `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`: The alias name of your app in the keystore
