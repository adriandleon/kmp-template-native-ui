/**
 * Main analytics implementation that supports multiple providers simultaneously.
 *
 * This implementation acts as a coordinator that forwards analytics events to all configured
 * providers. It provides several benefits:
 * - **Provider redundancy**: Events are sent to multiple services for reliability
 * - **A/B testing**: Compare different analytics providers
 * - **Gradual migration**: Switch providers without losing data
 * - **Cost optimization**: Use different providers for different event types
 *
 * The implementation is designed to be:
 * - **Thread-safe**: Can be called from any thread
 * - **Non-blocking**: Provider failures don't affect the main application
 * - **Efficient**: Optimized for batch event processing
 * - **Extensible**: Easy to add new providers
 *
 * @param providers The list of analytics providers to use. Each provider will receive all events.
 *   Providers should handle errors gracefully internally.
 * @see Analytics for the interface contract
 * @see AnalyticsProvider for provider implementations
 * @example
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * // Create analytics with multiple providers
 * val analytics = AnalyticsImpl(
 *     providers = listOf(
 *         FirebaseAnalyticsProvider(),
 *         CustomBackendProvider(),
 *         LocalStorageProvider()
 *     )
 * )
 *
 * // Track events - will be sent to all providers
 * analytics.track(CommonAnalyticsEvent.ScreenView("HomeScreen", "HomeComponent"))
 *
 * // Track multiple events efficiently
 * val events = listOf(
 *     CommonAnalyticsEvent.ButtonClick("LoginButton"),
 *     CommonAnalyticsEvent.SelectItem("item123", "Product A")
 * )
 * analytics.track(events)
 * ```
